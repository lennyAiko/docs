    <p>My name is Lennox Charles Confident. I am 18 years old, i live in 209 road c close house 1 festac town. My state of origin is Delta state, Ika-south local government area. My favourite is any food that is edible ;-). I love listening to music and audio books alot but mostly audiobooks. i like having fun when necessary and being serious when i'm needed to be. i really don't like being in the midst of crowd, i like to single myself out.</p>
    <p>I chose to become a computer scientist because i loved the complexity of how technologies works and how wonderful it will become if everyone is able to adapt to the technological age that we have entered.</p>
